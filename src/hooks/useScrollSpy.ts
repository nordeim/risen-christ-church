 * Track which of the given section ids is currently crossing the viewport's
 * middle band (round 7 — Ministries scrollspy). A single IntersectionObserver
 * with asymmetric top/bottom insets (-45% / -50%) isolates the thin horizontal
 * band spanning 45–50% of the viewport height, just above its center, where a
 * reader's eye sits; the deepest section in document order that is crossing
 * the band wins (batched entries are resolved by document order, not delivery
 * order — round-7 audit L-2), and the pill holds its position when nothing
 * intersects. Falls back to the first id, tolerates ids with no matching
 * element, and disconnects on unmount. Callers may pass module-constant
 * arrays or inline literals: the effect re-runs on the joined id string, so
 * either is safe.
